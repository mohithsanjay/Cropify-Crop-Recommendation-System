## Crop Recommendation System
This simple crop recommender system was trained using Random Forest Algorithm in giving recommendations to farmers the best and suitable crop based on an Indian Crop Recommendation Dataset. 
By inputing N, P, K, and pH values based on soil conditions, weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, and regional location, the system can recommend what the best and most suitable crop to plant.
This project is in partial fulfillment of the Final Project on MAN206 Predictive Modelling and Machine Learning.
